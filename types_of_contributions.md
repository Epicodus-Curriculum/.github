## üêû Issues
Issues are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. 

An issues tracker can be found in every repository.

## üõ†Ô∏è Pull Requests
A pull request (PR) is a way to suggest changes to a repository. If we merge those changes, they should be deployed to LearnHowToProgram.com by the end of the week. 

We recommend you only create pull request to resolve existing issues that do NOT have a **triage** label. These issues haven't been reviewed by an Epicodus staff member yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it. An exception is you may readily create pull requests to fix typos and minor grammatical mistakes without needing to first create an issue.

### What we can't accept pull requests for
We cannot accept pull requests for brand new learning material or extensive redesign/updates.

The source content in this repository is written in English. We do not currently accept contributions for translated content.

## ‚ùì Support

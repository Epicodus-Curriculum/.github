# WELCOME

Hi there.ðŸ‘‹ My name is Morrie, Director of Curriculum at Epicodus. Welcome to the Epicodus Curriculum community.

## JOIN THE COMMUNITY

Participating in this community will give you insight into the development process and maintenance of Epicodusâ€™s technical curriculum. You can ask questions, join the discussion forums, and offer constructive feedback. Iâ€™m here to offer my perspective as an instructional designer for Epicodus and to answer any questions you have.

I canâ€™t help with aspects outside Epicodusâ€™s technical curriculum such as admissions, payment, policy, career services, or personal outcomes. For issues unrelated to the technical curriculum, contact Epicodus staff directly via the means described in this link to [Epicodus's handbook]().

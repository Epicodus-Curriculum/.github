## Issues

### Create a new issue
If you spot a problem in LearnHowToProgram.com, search if a similar issue already exists. Open an issue if it is something new. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### Solving an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to assign it to yourself and then start on making changes.
